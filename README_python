JANUS DRONE SCRIPTS

Here are the scripts to control Janus via the command line,
for the purpose of automating data taking while operating
from a drone using the pixhawk 2.4.8 flight controller (FC)
when connected via the TELEM2 port.

Confirm connection:
With the flight controller powered on and connected, verify
connection using the command:

sudo ~/droneenv/bin/mavproxy.py --master=/dev/serial0 --baudrate 921600

If you see "MAV> Detected vehicle 1:1 on link 0" in the output, the pi
is detecting the flight controller.

Running scripts:
First activate the virtual environment using:

source ~/droneenv/bin/activate

Then, to make a python script executable (only needs to be done once), do:

chmod +x waypoint_janus_control.py (substituting your new script)

And to run the script, do:

sudo ./waypoint_janus_control.py

Waypoint Janus Control:

This script will first attempt to connect to the FC.
After connecting, it will wait for the first waypoint index to open 
Janus and turn on the voltage. Then it will then wait for a second waypoint 
index to start recording. Then it will stop / turn off voltage at a third 
waypoint index.

It is currently set up to record using whatever configuration settings
are currently saved in Janus_Config.txt. Ensure the proper voltage is
set correctly before running.

Test Janus Recording:

This script runs Janus without communicating with the flight controller.
Like above, it uses the configuration settings currently saved in
Janus_Config.txt. Ensure that the proper voltage is set correctly before running.
