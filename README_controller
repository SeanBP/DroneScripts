Flight Controller Setup:

To connect the Raspberry Pi to the Pixhawk 2.4.8 flight controller (FC), find the
three wires connected to the TELEM2 port, using a 6-pin connector. The order
should be:

EMPTY - BLACK - WHITE - EMPTY - EMPTY - RED

Now locate the two long rows of pins on the Raspberry Pi. Orient the Pi
such that the side with the pins is facing you (and the power is facing away).
On the row of pins closest to the edge, the wires should be connected in this order:

[15 EMPTY] - BLACK - WHITE - RED - EMPTY - EMPTY

The FC requires its own power source seperate from the Pi.
